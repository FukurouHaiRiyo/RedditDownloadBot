# RedditDownloadBot
  This python script is a program that downlaods photos from a Reddit subreddit. The script will ask for the subreddit you want to 
download from, then it will ask if you want to download from top, hot or new. After this, it will take a few seconds to download them and they will appear in the 
current working directory. The script is set to download a maximum of 10 photos, but you can modify the limit to be higher or lower based on your
prefference.

# How to use
   Visit https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps to make a new app. After you create it, you can copy the username, the client_id and the client_secret and
copy them in the 'credidentials.json' file. Make sure you make another Reddit account and use that account to test this program, because your main account might be banned.
